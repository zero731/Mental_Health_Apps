The price was steep and not being able to apply a discount code after account creation is an absolute deal breaker. If I had understood that, I would have not created an account. My bank account really couldn’t handle the cost in the first place due to COVID-19. I’m really am sorry to complain, but I can’t see this service applicable to my struggles with mental health. Creative and real in person therapy in my area is much cheaper and upon speaking to my new therapist, she was even appalled with my experience with your counselor. It felt as if I was the one being paid to speak to her than her being a licensed therapist here for me. I understand that times are tough for absolutely everyone, but in my time of need, I felt very ignored and belittled by this whole experience and only wanted a place that was safe for me and easily accessible. Currently, my thoughts on BetterHelp are poor and I see the ads as very misleading. I can only think of this as some sort of pyramid scheme to take money from sick people and provide them with mediocre care because they’re unaware of the resources found in their own city. As I type this, I can only hope that someone will read it and not hope I’m a bad or overdramatic person because I really was open to this method of therapy and really thought I would leave this program happy and I’m only left with the same problems if not more. I really never do this and I apologize for the novel, but if I had a friend in need, I feel as if I could lend a better hand and help them for more than this app and the $260 dollars I paid when I’m very much struggling to make ends meet. I gave up my rent to get help and had someone respond to my crisis with an emoji and met with silence. No sense of urgency or care. It doesn’t feel humane and was very robotic. I have screenshots of our conversation and am definitely wanting to show our conversation with someone who cares at BetterHelp. I’m sorry, once again. But I don’t recommend this app to anyone and am very hurt. My mental health felt like no less of a priority than a Netflix subscription. \\nThis is only my experience and I know that, but I’m so very hurt by this.</th>\n",

While the convenience of having your journal with you anytime, any place is an wonderful innovation, the functionality of moving through a feed makes looking backward less easy than a physical journal. Here are a couple of suggestions to remedy. \\n\\nCreate a skim feature for journal entries. Being able to move quickly through the content would be helpful, like opening up your journal in a random place and flipping through pages. \\nUse AI to read my journal and make connections that my little brain cannot. \\nSuggest past entries that correlate to my here and now (by date, activity, mood etc). \\nThanks for all of the love that you put into your app.</th>\n",

Fast forward to 2020 - I became a first-time mom at 38 years old, suffered from postpartum depression, and just when I was starting to find my footing, the world was immediately hurled into the COVID-19 pandemic. The stress wreaked havoc on my body. Everyday I felt like I was physically drowning; my chest was cramped, my muscles ached, I was permanently exhausted but couldn’t sleep, and my brain was foggy. I tried taking anxiety medication and it made me extremely nauseous, which further triggered my anxiety. I thought I was doomed; I felt so helpless. Then I read Dan Harris’s book, 10% Happier, and I figured if meditation helped him, maybe it would help me. Now I use the app daily, in conjunction with a daily routine that involves yoga, reasonably healthy eating, supplements as recommended by my physician, and continued communication and collaboration with my support net of friends and family. It’s part of a bigger picture, and it has made a world of difference. Physically, the chest tightness and muscular tension have decreased significantly. And mentally I find myself much more resilient in the face of stress, especially the kind induced by the intrusive irrational fears that come with GAD. Thank you to the 10% Happier team.

I like that I have access to all the emotions and the mood tracker...kind of. But i was really disappointed when I saw that I have to pay so much money that I don’t have and can’t spend on an app to be able to have mental health check ins, to be able to meditate, have help sleeping, help me in an attack, etc. Essentially you have to pay for the whole point of this app. \\n\\nGranted I understand that this app is a way for the developers to make money. But not all of us have that kind of money just laying around and not all of us are adults that can pay for those things and work to make it up again. Just as a suggestion, maybe make it so that those of us that aren’t 18+ yet don’t have to pay for everything, but maybe make some limited features to counteract that.
