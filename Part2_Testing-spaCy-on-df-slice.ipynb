       "      <th>I love the app! Ive been looking for an app like this for a while. I have multiple soberity dates and this app lets me track all of them &amp; even gives me the option to create my own addiction I'm \"counting sober time\" for. I've had the app for about 2 months, so I can honestly say it's a great app. I also love the daily pledges &amp; now with the most recent update you can rate how easy or hard it was to say sober for the day. Awesome-sauce keep up the great word! Beautiful UI!   The only requests/complaints is I wish there was a widget for my home screen. More inspiring quotes.. And I wish there was mile stone accomplishments for numbered days like, example; 11 days, 111 days sober 555 days sober, 777 days sober, 1111 days sober 22222 days sober - &amp; so on! But ya that's it!</th>\n",

Its too confusing. \\nToo me moods an emotions are very different. That i would prefer having the “awful to awesome” 5 face rating, and then separately have my custom emotions of sad, depressed, happy, joyful eg. I can be “sad and awful” or “sad and meh”. There menu system try's to incorporate both into the same system and its doesn't work. It forces people to think about emotions in overly linear ways\\n\\nAlso note, that the app best works when you group your activities under the correct mood. So if you rate 1x a day it wont accurately match how the actual activity made you feel. But it could better calculate how you the activity affected the rest of your day. \\n\\nGreat app</th>\n",
